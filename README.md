# zero-backend-webapp
An experimental web app without a back-end

Text storage for the masses. Yes, no server, no database, but it WILL store your text reliably (and encrypted?).

Cloud services:
* http://myjson.com/api
* Netlify.

TODO:
* Sanitize input
* Client-side unique URL dynamic hash (maybe need React Router, sigh)
